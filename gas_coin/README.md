# GasCoin

## Introduction
We have come up with an innovative idea of GasCoin prepaid card which can be used at independent gas stations while buying gas. The technology used to create these cards is based on blockchains and crypto currency. The card is both physical and electronic.

After an initial analysis, we have found a market of independent gas stations which stay deserted as they do not get enough customers due to lack of trust with gas quality and services. We want to help these gas stations to build a network of them in the market and build trust among their customers so they can improve their business.
